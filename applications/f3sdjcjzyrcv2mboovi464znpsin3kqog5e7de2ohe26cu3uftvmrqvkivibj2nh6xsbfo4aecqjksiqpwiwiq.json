    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB), serves as the hub for the global Protein Data Bank, a repository for 3D structural data of proteins and nucleic acids. It began as a small archive and grew into the world’s leading resource for structural biology. The RCSB PDB enhances data access, validation, and tools for research in drug design and biotechnology. With over 220,000 structures, it offers like PDB and mmCIF, supporting science and education.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) stores 3D structural data of biological macromolecules. This includes atomic coordinates and annotations for proteins and nucleic acids in formats like PDB, mmCIF, and CIF. The data supports structural biology research, drug design, and biotechnology applications. With over 220,000 structures, the dataset enables global scientific collaboration and education.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "To prepare dataset, we begin by segmenting the 3D structural data of biological macromolecules, including atomic coordinates and annotations in PDB, mmCIF, and CIF formats, into manageable smaller chunks. Each chunk is processed using go-graphsplit to generate CAR files, with unique Content Identifiers (CIDs) assigned for tracking and retrieval. Metadata, such as file formats, structure IDs, and annotation details, is cataloged in a PostgreSQL database to ensure efficient indexing and access. Using the CID, the data can be easy to retrieved, to decrypted, and to accessed when needed.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://www.rcsb.org/docs/programmatic-access/file-download-services#automated-download-of-data",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Europe, South America, North America, Africa, Asia other than Greater China, Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "1. f03540552 Los Angeles, US\n2. f03540038 Moscow, Rusia\n3. f03538789 Ha Batrung, Vitan: Replaced with f02003699\n4. f03519246 Shenzhen, China\n5. f02006998 Thailand\n6. f02006988 United States\n7. f02006966 Singapore\n8. f02003777 Vietnam\n9. f02003699 Russia\n10. f03538789 Vietnam\n11. f03519300 China\n12. f03519341 Honkon",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
