    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The THUMOSAI, goal was to improve action recognition in videos, especially in untrimmed, real-world video clips â€” not just short, clean samples. The project introduced a benchmark challenge where researchers had to:\n1. Helped develop computer vision technologies used in areas like security, healthcare, and robotics.\n2. The science of teaching computers to understand images and video.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The data consists of video files and associated metadata from the THUMOS dataset. These videos are used for computer vision research, specifically for training and evaluating machine learning models in action recognition. The files include untrimmed video clips, action labels, and temporal annotations indicating when specific actions occur.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "Store data by importing it to create a unique Content Identifier (CID), then establish a storage deal. The data is segmented, encoded, and replicated for durability, sealed into sectors. Storage providers handle pre-commitment, sealing, and final commitment, submitting periodic proofs to verify integrity. The CID is used to retrieve, decode, and deliver the original content.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/THUMOS14/download.html",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "North America, Asia other than Greater China, Greater China, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Lotus built-in data transfer, HTTP or FTP server, IPFS, I don't know yet",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "1. f03540552 Los Angeles, US\n2. f03540038 Moscow, Rusia\n3. f03538789 Ha Batrung, Vitan\n4. f03519246 Shenzhen, China\n5. f03519341 HK,China",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
